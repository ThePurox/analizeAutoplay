#+TITLE: YouTube autoplay project
* general
** terminology
- /data/ refers to data in memory during run-time, e.g. classes, lists
- /files/ refer to data stored on hard disk
** cookie management
- cookies must not influence the outcome in order to make runs reproducible
** that should operate on data directly and that on files  
* mandatory [0/7]
** TODO video class
- should it have data structure already in it, i.e. ~next~ pointer?
** TODO data structure 
- not necessarily a real tree, needs to have merging and branching
- definitely not hierarchical 
** TODO visualization
- tree if there is tree structure
- otherwise draw links between videos and group them by category
** TODO categorize videos
- use youtube's categories
- youtube's tags are user defined, therefore not standardized
** TODO file structure
- for easy export of data and combination of several such files
- no idea yet, ~JSON~ or something
- should be expandable, if video class is expanded by new properties
- should be easily importable, that function must only be able to operate on data directly and not on files
** TODO generating seeds
- how to find the videos to start from
- random generation of video IDs is impossible
- random search request to youtube API?
** TODO download thumbnails or link them dynamically in visualization
- ~youtube-dl~ not necessary

* improvements [0/3]
** TODO use ~urllib~ for fetching  
** TODO use ~HtmlParser~ or ~BeautifulSoup~ for parsing ~html~
- that Manuel does not have to do so much hard work, pure fellow
** TODO possibility to combine resulting data from several runs and machines
- ties in closely with underlying file structure
